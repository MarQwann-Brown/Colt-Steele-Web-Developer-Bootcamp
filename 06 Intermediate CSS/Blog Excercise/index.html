				The palatable sensation we lovingly refer to as The Cheeseburger has a distinguished and illustrious history. It was born from humble roots, only to rise to well-seasoned greatness.
			</p>
			<p>
				We are lucky to live in a glorious age that gives us everything we could ask for as a human race. What more could you need when you have meat covered in cheese nestled between bread as a complete meal.

				From smashed patties at Shake Shack to Glamburgers at Honky Tonk, there’s a little something for everyone. Some burgers are humble, and some are ostentatious, and you just have to try them all to figure out what you want.

			<p class="quote">Let us wax poetic about the beauty of the cheeseburger. The flavour gracefully dances across your palate like a majestic figure skater on ice.</p>

			<p>The cheese melts on the burger and in your mouth, perfectly complementing the medium-rare beef. Any burger lover worth their salt knows the best patty is comprised of ground chuck and brisket.</p>
			<p>
				Whether you’re a ketchup and mustard loyalist or you prefer house sauce to no sauce, you can agree that every cheeseburger has it’s own special flair. Top tip: house sauce begs to be ordered on the side for fry-dipping purposes.
